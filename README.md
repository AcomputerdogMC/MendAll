MendAll - A bukkit plugin to apply mending to all items
---
MendAll is a very simple plugin that allows a player to manually convert XP into mending repairs.  Players can type /mend to apply as much XP as possible to every item with mending.

Experience code is a fork of RichardB122's ExperienceManager, and can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/warriordog/6160a1ed45134265fb30b8d224da0426).
